Excellent question, Sanket 👏 — this shows you’re starting to think like a React developer, understanding not just “what happens,” but why React behaves that way under the hood.

Let’s break this down very clearly 👇

⚙️ 1️⃣ By default — Yes, a React component executes only once

When React first renders your component (on mount),
it calls the function once to know what to display on the screen.

Example:

function App() {
console.log("App component executed");
return <h1>Hello React!</h1>;
}

🖥️ Output in console:

App component executed

It appears only once when the app loads.

🧠 2️⃣ Why does React execute it only once?

Because React is declarative, not imperative.

👉 The component’s function is not like a loop or event listener.
It’s a “UI recipe.”
React calls it to know what the UI should look like for the current state.

Once it has rendered it, React does not re-run the function unless it needs to.

🔁 3️⃣ When does React re-execute a component?

React re-renders (i.e., re-executes the component function) whenever something that affects its output changes.

That includes:

State changes via useState

const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
setCount(count + 1); // triggers re-render

Props changes (parent passes new values)

Context changes (if using React Context API)

Forced re-render (rare — using key or forceUpdate)

So the component function is executed again whenever React needs to refresh that part of the UI.

🧩 4️⃣ Example
import { useState } from "react";

function App() {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

console.log("Component executed");

return (
<div>
<h1>Count: {count}</h1>
<button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
</div>
);
}

🧠 Output:

Component executed // when app loads
Component executed // when button clicked
Component executed // each time count updates

Because changing state (setCount) → triggers re-render → React re-calls the component function.

🚫 5️⃣ What doesn’t cause re-render

Changing a normal variable

Direct DOM manipulation

Console logging

Timeout without state update

Example:

let counter = 0;

function App() {
console.log("Rendered:", counter);

return (
<button onClick={() => counter++}>
Increase
</button>
);
}

Even if you click 10 times — UI won’t update because React isn’t tracking counter (it’s not state).

✅ 6️⃣ Summary
Action Does Component Re-render? Why
Initial render ✅ Mount
useState update ✅ State triggers re-render
Props change ✅ Parent passes new data
Normal variable change ❌ React not aware
DOM change via JS ❌ React doesn’t track DOM
setCount() ✅ State change triggers React diffing
🔥 In short:

React component executes once by default,
and re-executes automatically when its state, props, or context change.

Would you like me to show a visual example (React flow diagram) of how state triggers re-rendering? It really helps make this concept permanent.
